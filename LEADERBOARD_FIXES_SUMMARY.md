# Leaderboard Fixes & Improvements Summary

## ✅ **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION**

We have successfully implemented the three key actions that place users on the leaderboard:

### 🔌 **1. Connecting to the dApp**

**✅ Automatic User Creation & Points**
- Any user who connects to the dApp is automatically stored in the database
- **NEW**: Users receive **25 engagement points** for first-time connection (`CONNECT_WALLET` activity)
- All connected users now appear on the leaderboard immediately
- **Activity Status Tracking**: Users are categorized as:
  - 🟢 **Active**: Have predictions or engagement points
  - 🆕 **New User**: Connected within 7 days, no activity yet
  - 👀 **Tourist**: Connected >7 days ago with no activity

**✅ Tourist Cleanup Mechanism**
- Admin endpoint: `POST /api/users/cleanup-tourists`
- Archives inactive wallets (>30 days, no activity) to `tourist_wallets` table
- Keeps leaderboard clean while preserving data

### 👤 **2. Setting Username**

**✅ Profile Completion Tracking**
- Users receive **50 engagement points** for setting their username (`COMPLETE_PROFILE` activity)
- Username updates are immediately reflected in the leaderboard
- Duplicate username prevention

### 🐦 **3. Linking 𝕏 (Twitter) Account**

**✅ Twitter Integration Points**
- Users receive **100 engagement points** for linking Twitter (`LINK_TWITTER` activity)
- Uses the engagement service for consistent point tracking
- Only awarded once per Twitter account
- Supports multi-wallet Twitter linking architecture

# Engagement sorting works
curl "http://localhost:5001/api/leaderboard?sortBy=engagement"
