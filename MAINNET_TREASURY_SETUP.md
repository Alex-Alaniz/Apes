# üè¶ Mainnet Treasury Setup Complete

## Summary

The platform has been configured to use the proper mainnet treasury wallets:

### Official Mainnet Treasury Addresses

‚úÖ **PRIMAPE Treasury**: `APEShoBNNvnM4JV6pW51vb8X4Cq6ZeZy6DqfjmTu6j4z`
- Purpose: PRIMAPE ecosystem development
- Receives: All contract fees (currently 3.5% total due to smart contract limitations)

‚úÖ **Community Treasury**: `APESxbwPNyJW62vSY83zENJwoL2gXJ8HbpMBPWwJKGi2`
- Purpose: Community initiatives and platform operations
- Receives: Will receive 1% platform fees in smart contract v2

## Files Updated

1. **src/frontend/src/config/solana.js**
   - Added separate treasury configurations for devnet and mainnet
   - Exported `PRIMAPE_TREASURY` and `COMMUNITY_TREASURY` constants

2. **src/frontend/src/config/networks.json**
   - Updated with proper mainnet treasury addresses
   - Fixed token decimals (9 for mainnet PRIMAPE)

3. **scripts/initialize-platform-mainnet.js** (NEW)
   - Created dedicated mainnet initialization script
   - Includes safety checks and confirmation prompts
   - Uses PRIMAPE Treasury as the main treasury address

4. **TREASURY_CONFIGURATION.md** (NEW)
   - Complete documentation of treasury structure
   - Fee distribution explanation
   - Future improvement plans

## Current Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Smart Contract v1 Limitation**: The current smart contract only supports ONE treasury address. This means:
- All fees (3.5% total) go to a single address
- We're using PRIMAPE Treasury since it receives the majority of fees
- Community Treasury will be implemented in smart contract v2

## What Happens Now

### On Devnet (Testing)
- All fees go to test address: `4FxpxY3RRN4GQnSTTdZe2MEpRQCdTVnV3mX9Yf46vKoS`

### On Mainnet (Production)
- All fees go to PRIMAPE Treasury: `APEShoBNNvnM4JV6pW51vb8X4Cq6ZeZy6DqfjmTu6j4z`
- In v2, we'll split: 2.5% to PRIMAPE, 1% to Community

## Frontend Display
The UI correctly shows where fees are intended to go:
- "Platform Fee (1%) ‚Üí Community Treasury"
- "Contract Fee (2.5%) ‚Üí PRIMAPE"

Even though they currently go to the same address, users understand the intended distribution.

## Next Steps for Mainnet Deployment

1. **Verify Treasury Addresses** - Double-check the addresses are correct
2. **Initialize Platform** - Run: `node scripts/initialize-platform-mainnet.js --confirm-mainnet`
3. **Verify on Solscan** - Check that fees are going to the correct wallet
4. **Plan v2 Upgrade** - Implement proper fee splitting in next contract version

## Security Notes

- Never commit mainnet private keys
- Use environment variables for mainnet deployer wallet path
- Always verify addresses on Solscan before major operations
- Test everything on devnet first

---

‚úÖ The platform is now ready for mainnet deployment with proper treasury configuration!
