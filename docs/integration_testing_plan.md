   - Steps:
     1. User connects wallet
     2. User places a bet on a market
     3. System burns 2.5% of bet amount
     4. Market is resolved
     5. User claims rewards
     6. System burns 1.5% of reward amount
   - Expected Result: All steps complete successfully, correct amounts are burned

2. **Market Creation to Resolution Flow**
   - Test ID: E2E-002
