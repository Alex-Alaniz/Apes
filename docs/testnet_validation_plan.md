## Test Cases

### Smart Contract Test Cases

1. **Platform Initialization**
   - Initialize platform with valid parameters
   - Attempt to initialize platform twice (should fail)
   - Initialize with invalid parameters (should fail)

2. **Market Creation**
   - Create market with valid parameters
   - Create market with invalid end date (should fail)
   - Create market with insufficient stake (should fail)
   - Create market with too many options (should fail)

3. **Prediction Placement**
   - Place prediction on valid market
   - Place prediction on expired market (should fail)
   - Place prediction with insufficient tokens (should fail)
   - Place prediction on resolved market (should fail)

4. **Market Resolution**
   - Resolve market as admin
   - Attempt to resolve market as non-admin (should fail)
   - Resolve already resolved market (should fail)
   - Resolve with invalid winning option (should fail)

5. **Reward Claiming**
   - Claim reward as winner
   - Attempt to claim reward as loser (should fail)
   - Attempt to claim reward twice (should fail)
   - Claim reward with market not resolved (should fail)

### Frontend Test Cases

1. **Market Browsing**
   - Filter markets by category
   - Sort markets by end date
   - Search markets by keyword
   - Pagination of market listings

2. **Market Detail View**
   - View market details
   - View prediction distribution
   - View market status
   - View time remaining

3. **Prediction Placement**
   - Enter prediction amount
   - Select prediction option
   - Confirm transaction
   - View updated prediction distribution

4. **User Dashboard**
   - View active predictions
   - View historical predictions
   - View pending rewards
   - View claimed rewards

### Backend Test Cases

1. **API Endpoints**
   - GET /markets (retrieve all markets)
   - GET /markets/:id (retrieve specific market)
   - POST /markets (create new market)
   - GET /predictions (retrieve user predictions)
   - POST /predictions (create new prediction)

2. **Data Processing**
   - Market data aggregation
   - Prediction statistics calculation
   - User history compilation
   - Token burn statistics

### Integration Test Cases

1. **BelieveApp Integration**
   - Process token burn for bet

   - Execute token swap
   - Handle pool errors

## Test Data

The following test data will be created during testnet deployment:

1. **Test Markets**
   - "Will BTC reach $100,000 by end of 2025?" (Yes/No)
   - "Who will win the 2025 Super Bowl?" (Multiple teams)
   - "Which tech company will have the highest market cap in Q3 2025?" (Multiple companies)
   - "Will Ethereum complete its next upgrade by July 2025?" (Yes/No)

2. **Test Predictions**
   - Various predictions on different markets
   - Different amounts and options
   - Different user wallets

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites
- Testnet deployment completed
- Test wallets created and funded
- Test token distributed

### Execution Steps
1. Execute test cases in order of phases
2. Document results for each test case
3. Fix any issues identified
4. Re-test failed test cases
5. Perform regression testing after fixes

## Success Criteria
- All critical and high-priority test cases pass
- No security vulnerabilities identified
- Performance meets acceptable thresholds
- All integrations function correctly
- User flows complete without errors

## Reporting

A comprehensive test report will be generated after testnet validation, including:
- Test case execution results
- Issues identified and fixed
- Performance metrics
- Recommendations for mainnet deployment

## Post-Validation Steps

After successful testnet validation:
1. Address any issues identified
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Prepare for mainnet deployment
4. Create mainnet deployment plan
