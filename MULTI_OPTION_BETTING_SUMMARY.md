# Multi-Option Betting Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully implemented a multi-option betting system for the Solana prediction market platform that allows users to:
- **Bet on multiple options** within the same market
- **Add to existing positions** on any option
- **Support markets with 2-4 options**

## Technical Changes

### 1. Smart Contract Changes (`lib.rs`)

#### PDA Seeds Update
```rust
// OLD: [b"prediction", market, user]
// NEW: [b"prediction", market, user, option_index]
```
This allows each (user, option) pair to have its own independent prediction account.

#### Prediction Struct Simplification
```rust
pub struct Prediction {
    pub user: Pubkey,
    pub option_index: u8,  // Kept for clarity
    pub amount: u64,
    pub timestamp: i64,
    pub claimed: bool,
    // REMOVED: market field (now in PDA)
}
```

#### PlacePrediction Updates
- Added `#[instruction(option_index: u8)]` to struct
- Uses `init_if_needed` to allow adding to existing positions
- Removed restriction on changing options
- Removed `CannotChangeOption` error

#### ClaimReward Updates
- Added `#[instruction(option_index: u8)]` to struct
- Updated PDA derivation to include option_index
- Function signature now accepts `option_index` parameter

### 2. Frontend Service Updates (`marketService.js`)

#### Updated Functions
- **placeBet**: Now includes option_index in PDA derivation
- **claimReward**: Accepts option_index instead of predictionPubkey
- **getUserBets**: Simplified to work without market field in Prediction

#### New Function
- **getUserPositionsForMarket**: Returns all positions for a user in a specific market (array of positions)

### 3. Build Configuration
- Added `init-if-needed` feature to anchor-lang in Cargo.toml

## How It Works

### Placing Bets
1. User selects a market and option
2. System derives PDA: `[b"prediction", market, user, option_index]`
3. If PDA doesn't exist: creates new prediction
4. If PDA exists: adds to existing amount
5. User can repeat for other options in same market

### Example Scenario
```
Market: "Will BTC hit $100k by 2025?"
Options: ["Yes", "No"]

User Actions:
1. Bet 10 APES on "Yes" (option 0) → Creates prediction account
2. Bet 20 APES on "No" (option 1) → Creates separate prediction account
3. Bet 5 more APES on "Yes" → Adds to existing position (now 15 APES)
```

### Claiming Rewards
- Each option has its own claim process
- User must claim each winning position separately
- Only winning options can be claimed

## Benefits

1. **Hedging**: Users can hedge their bets by taking positions on multiple options
2. **Risk Management**: Spread risk across different outcomes
3. **Flexibility**: Add to positions over time as confidence changes
4. **Standard Behavior**: Matches typical prediction market functionality

## Migration Requirements

Since this changes the PDA structure:
1. Deploy new program (will get new program ID)
2. Update all configuration files with new program ID
3. Re-initialize platform and access control
4. All existing markets and predictions will be lost

## Testing

Created test script: `scripts/test-multi-option-betting.js`
- Tests betting on multiple options
- Tests adding to existing positions
- Verifies separate PDAs for each option

## Frontend TODOs

The frontend needs updates to:
1. Show all user positions per market (not just one)
2. Update claim process to handle per-option claims
3. Update UI to clearly show multiple positions
4. Profile page should group positions by market and option

## Security Considerations

- Each prediction is isolated by option
- Users cannot change their option choice after initial bet
- Standard Anchor account validation ensures proper authorization
- init_if_needed is safe here since we only add amounts, never reset
