## Files Modified

1. **PredictionModal.jsx**
   - Enhanced fee breakdown with destination labels
   - Added note that Believe burn applies to claims too
   - Improved visual hierarchy with colors

2. **ClaimRewardModal.jsx** (New)
   - Created dedicated modal for claiming rewards
   - Shows all fees before confirming claim
   - Integrates Believe API burn call

3. **ProfilePage.jsx**
   - Updated to use ClaimRewardModal
   - Removed direct claim function
   - Better UX with preview before claiming

## Fee Destinations

- **Community Treasury**: Platform fees support the ecosystem
- **PRIMAPE**: Contract fees (currently go to treasury address)
- **Token Burn**: Fixed amount burned via Believe API from LP wallet

## Notes

- The contract still performs a 3-way split (pool + burn + fee)
- The "burn" from contract goes to treasury as a workaround
- Real burns happen via Believe API from separate LP wallet
- Burns are non-blocking - failures don't affect transactions
