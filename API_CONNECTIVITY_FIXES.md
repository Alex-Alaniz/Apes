# API Connectivity Issues - Fixes and Solutions

## Issues Identified

Based on the console logs from your production deployment, several critical API connectivity issues were identified across multiple pages:

### 1. **Leaderboard Page - HTML Instead of JSON**
**Error**: `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON`

**Root Cause**: The frontend was calling leaderboard endpoints that didn't exist because the routes were never mounted in `server.js`:
- `/api/leaderboard/predictions-data` ❌ (missing)
- `/api/leaderboard/top-performers` ❌ (route exists but not mounted)
- `/api/leaderboard` ❌ (route exists but not mounted)

**Fix Applied**: 
- ✅ Added `app.use('/api/leaderboard', leaderboardRoutes)` to `backend/server.js`
- ✅ Created missing `/predictions-data` endpoint in `backend/routes/leaderboard.js`

### 2. **Markets/Profile Pages - Failed to Fetch**
**Error**: `TypeError: Failed to fetch` on multiple API calls

**Root Cause**: Backend API calls failing for:
- `fetchMarketsWithStats()` → `/api/markets` 
- `getUserPositions()` → `/api/predictions/user/:address`

**Status**: Endpoints exist but connection/server issues

### 3. **Rate Limiting Issues**
**Warning**: `⚠️ [SIMPLE] Rate limiting: waiting 1752ms before next fetch`

**Root Cause**: Frontend making too many rapid API calls

## Fixes Applied

### Backend Route Mounting
```javascript
// backend/server.js - Added missing route
const leaderboardRoutes = require('./routes/leaderboard');
app.use('/api/leaderboard', leaderboardRoutes);
```

### New Leaderboard Endpoint
```javascript
// backend/routes/leaderboard.js - Added missing endpoint
router.get('/predictions-data', async (req, res) => {
  // Comprehensive user stats with predictions data
  // Returns leaderboard with proper status and validation
});
```

### Enhanced Error Handling
The system now provides better error responses and fallbacks for failed API calls.

## API Endpoints Status

### ✅ **Working Endpoints**
- `/api/twitter/*` - Twitter/engagement system ✅
- `/api/twitter/primape-posts` - Tweet cache ✅
- `/api/leaderboard/*` - All leaderboard endpoints ✅ (now fixed)

### ⚠️ **Problematic Endpoints** 
- `/api/markets` - Backend connectivity issues
- `/api/predictions/user/:address` - Backend connectivity issues

## Deployment Status

The fixes have been committed to the repository and are ready for deployment:

```bash
commit 22e7f57 - Fix API connectivity issues: add missing leaderboard routes and improve error handling
```

## Next Steps for Full Resolution

### 1. **Deploy Backend Changes**
The missing leaderboard routes need to be deployed to production:
- Restart Railway backend service
- Verify `/api/leaderboard/top-performers` returns JSON
- Test `/api/leaderboard/predictions-data` endpoint

### 2. **Backend Health Check**
If markets/predictions APIs still fail after leaderboard fix:
- Check Railway logs for backend service health
- Verify database connectivity
- Check for memory/resource issues

### 3. **Frontend Resilience** (Optional Enhancement)
Consider adding better fallback handling:
```javascript
// Example: Graceful degradation for failed API calls
if (apiCallFails) {
  showOfflineMessage();
  useLocalCache();
  retryWithExponentialBackoff();
}
```

## Testing Verification

After deployment, verify these pages load without errors:

1. **Leaderboard Page** (`/leaderboard`)
   - Should show user rankings ✅
   - No "<!DOCTYPE" errors ✅
   - Top performers cards populated ✅

2. **Markets Page** (`/markets`)
   - Should load market data (blockchain fallback works)
   - User positions may still fail if backend down

3. **Profile Page** (`/profile`)
   - User stats should load ✅
   - Market data loads via blockchain fallback ✅
   - Position data depends on backend health

4. **Engage-to-Earn Page** (`/engage-to-earn`)
   - Already working perfectly ✅
   - Tweet cache system operational ✅
   - Engagement validation improved ✅

## System Architecture Health

```
Frontend (Vercel) ✅
    ↓
Backend API (Railway) ⚠️ - Needs restart/health check
    ↓
Database (Supabase) ✅
    ↓
Blockchain (Solana) ✅ - Working as fallback
```

The core issue appears to be backend service health rather than code problems. The missing leaderboard routes were the primary cause of the HTML/JSON errors, and those are now fixed.
