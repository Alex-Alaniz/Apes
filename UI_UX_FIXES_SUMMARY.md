# UI/UX Fixes Summary

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Market Detail Page Routing (Fixed ✅)
**Problem**: Clicking "View Details" resulted in 404 error
**Cause**: Route mismatch - links used `/market/:id` but route was defined as `/markets/:id`
**Solution**: Updated navigation paths in:
- `MarketCard.jsx` - Line 36: Changed to `/markets/${market.publicKey}`
- `ProfilePage.jsx` - Line 362: Changed to `/markets/${marketPubkey}`

### 2. Profile Page Enhancement (Completed ✅)
**Added Features**:
- **Editable Username**: Users can now set and edit their display name
- **Persistent Storage**: Username saved to localStorage per wallet
- **Validation**: 3-20 character limit with error messages
- **Inline Editing**: Clean UI with edit/save/cancel buttons
- **Default Username**: Auto-generates from wallet address if not set

## 📝 Implementation Details

### Username Editing Flow:
1. Click the edit icon (pencil) next to username
2. Enter new username (3-20 characters)
3. Click Save to confirm or Cancel to discard
